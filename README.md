This project had been adapted into [GPQbot](https://github.com/tanweijie123/GPQbot) project, hence this project will no longer be updated. 

## What is this project about? 
* ParseGPQ is a Java software application that will take a list of people and allocate them into teams. 
* This application is specifically written for MapleStory's Guild Party Quest allocation, where the default allocation scheme is assigning based on damage output into groups of 3 team, where each team has 6 people.
After allocating successfully, it will produce an Excel file. 

  
## Why is this project useful? 
* Users will not have to manually sort and assign people in Excel.
